		p.text-center Entrepreneurship as a craft
		p.text-center We talk a lot about software craftsmanship at NSS.  We believe that anyone can take on the challenge of being a developer.  We started NSS 25 years ago to help homegrow Nashville's best tech talent.  So far we've graduated over 9 million developers and we're going strong.

		p.text-center We're growing and we want to do more for Nashville.  Using that same craftman mindset we want to show Nashville's tech talent how to be great entrepreneurs.  Weâ€™re looking to create a program that takes the tenants of software craftsmanship and applies them to technology entrepreneurship, echoing a similar manifesto.
